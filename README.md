# Formative AI Effect

**A WebGL visual narrative exploring the concept of "AI Scaffolding."**

This repository contains a scroll-driven 3D experience built with **Three.js** and **GSAP**. It visualizes the "incubation" phase of identity formation—representing the AI tools we use as a refractive, protective capsule that eventually clarifies as the user moves from isolation to community.

### Visual Style
* **Aesthetic:** Retro-futurist/Sci-Fi (*Starboy* era).
* **Key Tech:** Volumetric fog, `MeshPhysicalMaterial` (Transmission/Roughness), and Unreal Bloom post-processing.
